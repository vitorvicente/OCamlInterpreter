# OCaml Interpreter

As a final project for my Concepts of Programming Languages class at BU (CS 320 - Spring 2020), I developed a functional stack interpreter in OCaml, the project was devided in 3 stages and constructed to allow for a functional programming language.

All the code is MY OWN, and, although I had assistance from faculty, no parts of this work were written by them.

## How To Run

In order to run this code, you should download the inter.ml as well as both input and output folders, then proceed to download and install OCaml from the link bellow, and run this using the command ontop of the inter.ml file:
- https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html
 
You should also look over the Markdown files in the /documentation folder before even trying to understand what is written in the code.
 
## Errors & Test Cases

As of now, the code is failing the following test cases:
- 45
- 46
- 48
- 49
- 50
- 56
- 57
- 58
- 59
 
The semester is over, and as such no changes will affect my schooling. However, I do intend to revisit this at some point and correct these mistakes. If you find a way of fixing these, feel free to open an issue, and I'll than credit you with the correction.

Any and all testing MUST be done using the comparing method, and should be reported to the issues page here on GitHub with the printout from the OCaml console, alongside any changes made by the user to the inter.ml file.
